## Overview

Ivan Shevtsov Documentation provides essential tools to organize, structure, and collaborate on your project docs. You create hierarchical spaces for content, manage versions, and enable team workflows. Master these core concepts to build effective documentation.

## Document Organization

Organize documents using folders and tags to keep content accessible. Create nested folders for topics like `api/`, `guides/`, and `reference/`. Add tags such as `v1.0`, `beta`, or `internal` for filtering.

<Callout kind="tip">
  Use consistent naming conventions like `kebab-case` for folders to improve navigation.

    Group related MDX files in directories.

    └── guides/
        └── quickstart.mdx

    ```yaml
    ---
    title: Endpoint Guide
    tags: ["api", "v2.0"]
    ---
    ```
  </Tab>

## Project Structures

Define project structures to scale documentation across repositories or versions. A typical structure includes a root `docs/` folder with MDX files, navigation configs, and assets.

```mermaid

    A[Project Root] --> B[docs/]
    B --> C[api/]
    C --> D[endpoints.mdx]
    B --> E[guides/]
    E --> F[quickstart.mdx]
    B --> G[assets/]
    B --> H[nav.json]
```

<CodeGroup tabs="Single Project,Multi-Project">
  ```json
  {
    "docs": {
      "api": ["endpoints.mdx"],
      "guides": ["setup.mdx"]
    }
  }
  ```
  ```json
  {
    "projects": {
      "v1": { "path": "docs-v1/" },
      "v2": { "path": "docs-v2/" }
    }
  }
  ```
