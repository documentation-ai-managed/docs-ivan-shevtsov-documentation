## Editing Documents

Edit your MDX files directly in your project repository. Use visual editors or code editors for syntax highlighting and previews.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Your Editor" icon="edit">
    Launch VS Code, Cursor, or any MDX-compatible editor. Open the `docs/managing-docs.mdx` file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make Changes" icon="save">
    Update content, add components, and preview live. Ensure you escape special characters like `{variable}` with backticks.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Preview Locally" icon="eye">
    Run `npm run dev` to serve your docs at `http://localhost:3000`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

  Always preview changes locally before committing to catch parsing errors early.

## Version Control

Integrate Git for tracking changes. Commit edits frequently with descriptive messages.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Initial Commit" icon="git-commit">
    Stage and commit your new documentation file.

    <CodeGroup tabs="bash">
      ```bash
      git add docs/managing-docs.mdx
      git commit -m "docs: add managing documentation guide"
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Branch Workflow" icon="git-branch">
    Create a feature branch for larger changes.

    <CodeGroup tabs="bash">
      ```bash
      git checkout -b feature/update-docs-guide
      git push origin feature/update-docs-guide
      ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Pull Request" icon="git-pull-request">
    Open a PR on GitHub for review.

    ```bash

## Exporting Content

Export your documentation for sharing or deployment. Choose formats based on your needs.

| Method | Tool | Use Case |
|--------|------|----------|
| Static Site | Next.js Export | Deploy to Vercel/Netlify |
| PDF | MDX to PDF | Printable guides |
| Markdown | Pandoc | Import to other platforms |

<Callout kind="info">
  Run `npm run build` to generate a static export of your entire docs site.
</Callout>

For custom exports, use this script:

```bash
npx @mdx-js/mdx @docs/managing-docs.mdx --output docs/exported.html
```

## Best Practices

- Write in active voice and use "you" for user-friendly instructions.
- Keep pages self-contained with 5-8 components for rich experiences.
- Test exports after major updates to ensure no parsing errors.

Follow these steps to streamline your documentation workflow and keep your project knowledge accessible.
